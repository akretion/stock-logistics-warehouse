Depend on sale_stock because a field toward a default warehouse is needed for each user.
It may be done in an additional module but it would then kind of conflict with sale_stock and would require a glue module to solve it.

Implement a way to change the current warehouse easily (scrolling menu on the side of the company scrolling menu)
